According to the data gathered and analyzed from kickstarter, it is apparent that the month of May has an increased chance of a kickstarter being successful. The month of Demcember is one of the least successful months. Theater plays also have a relatively high change of being a success. Plays, specifically in Great Britain have been successful between $537.50-$5,625 (between 1st and 3rd quartile).
Louise, start a campaign in the month of May or June and you are more likely to have success if your budget is below $6,000.
