Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
Using any found trends to analyze what makes a "successful" Kickstarter campaign, specifically for theater.

  According to the data gathered and analyzed from kickstarter, it is apparent that the month of May has an increased chance of a kickstarter being successful. The month of Demcember is one of the least successful months. Theater plays also have a relatively high change of being a success. Plays, specifically in Great Britain have been successful between $537.50-$5,625 (between 1st and 3rd quartile). Louise, start a campaign in the month of May or June and you are more likely to have success if your budget is below $6,000.

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

	Kickstarter Analysis

### Purpose
	
	The purpose of this project is to analyze Kickstarter campaigns and see if any conclusions can be drawn. Using the date launched and the goal amount of funding needed to have a successful campaign, are there any patterns or conclusions drawn?

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	Some challenges encountered during the analysis of the Kickstarter datasheet were remembering to change the timestamps into short dates and practicing the countif() expression.

## Results

	When analyzing theater outcomes based on launch date, we can conclude that Kickstarter campaigns which start on May have a greater rate of success. From May to September there is a downward trend in the number of successful campaigns. May has 111 successful campaigns, June has 100 successful campaigns, September has 59 successful campaigns. Campaigns launched in December had a total of 37 successful campaigns. December launched campaigns had the lowest number of campaigns which were a success.
	Outcomes based on goals show that campaigns that had goals less than $1000 had the highest success rate of 75.81%. Out of the 186 total projects where the goal was less than $1000, 141 of those projects met their goal. Next, campaigns that had a goal between $5000-$9999 had the second highest success rate where 377 campaigns out of 523 reached their goal, which is 72.08%. Also, these two goal ranges also had the largest number of total campaigns.
	Some limitations of this dataset are any other advertising the Kickstarter campaigns pursued. Were the successful campaigns advertised on other social media sites?
	Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create are the amount of backers a successful campaign has and the average amount pledged per successful campaign. We could also create graphs and/or tables showing the campaigns that were successful in varying countries depicting the successful campaigns in each.
